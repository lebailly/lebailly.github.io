# Data Science Specialization

Johns Hopkins University has put together a series of nine courses related to data science.  In addition to these foundational courses, this specialization offered the opportunity to do a capstone project upon competition of the courses.  At the current time, I have completed the foundational courses.  The capstone project has not been offered yet, but I look forward to it once it is available.  More details about the specialization are available [here][0].  

These courses were taught by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD at Johns Hopkins University (with the exception of Mathemtical Biostatists Boot Camp, which was just taught by Brian Caffo).
