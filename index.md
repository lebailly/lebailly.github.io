# About Me

My name is Chris LeBailly.  I am a life long learner and problem solver.

I began this journey as a student.  At Grinnell College I double majored in mathematics and music, and was close to a third major in physics.  After graduation I worked for two years in the Math Study Center at [Evanston Township High School][4].  I worked with students of varying abilities in mathematics, where I was able to explain the simple ideas of basic algebra to the more advanced underpinnings of Calculus to the more accelerated students.  I left this job to pursue graduate studies.  While I enjoyed furthering my education, I realized that academia was not my calling professionally and switched to the masters track (where I completed my [masters thesis][3]).

Since finishing my masters I have taken [this][2] graduate level course in bioinformatics (through the UCSC Extension Program) to learn about the field and sharpen my programing skills, taken several [coursera courses][5], as well as worked on several [independent data projects][6]. I want to make a positive difference in the world, and I am hoping to find a career path where I can use my analytic and programing skills to do this.

I am a self-motivated individual who can clearly communicate his ideas.  I am excited to enter a field which will not only allow, but require me, to continue to learn and grow as technology evolves.  I am excited to have this opportunity.

# Programs

My native programing language was C++, however I have not coded in C++ since 2004.  Since then I have worked primarily in **Python** and **R**.  I have also worked some with **Octave**/**Matlab** and also some with **Mathematica**.

<font size="5">[Bioinformatics: models and algorithms](https://github.com/lebailly/BME205) </font> - Programs written for [this][2] bioinformatics course, taken in the Fall of 2013 at UC Santa Cruz.

<font size="5">[Baseball Park Fairness](https://github.com/lebailly/BallParkFairness)</font> - Different ball parks in major league baseball are in different location and have different dimensions.  How fair is this?  This question is addressed using both simulations and data analysis.  While this work is a recent project, it is based of a paper produced for the HiMCM competition, which was published.

<font size="5">[Twitter Analysis](https://github.com/lebailly/IntroToDataScience/tree/master/assignment1)</font> - Collects current information from twitter and preform different types of basic analysis (such as listing the top hash tags and determining a numeric rating of the tweet sentiment).

<font size="5">[Titanic Data Project](https://github.com/lebailly/Titanic)</font> - In this project I apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.  This project (and data) was obtained from this [Kaggle compeition][1].

# Mathematics

<font size="5"> Masters Thesis</font> - I studied a phenomena observed in the 17th century by Christian Huygens. He found that two pendulum clocks placed on a common support synchronized over time. I looked a model of this type of coupling.  I looked at what happens when driven pendulums (which can exhibit chaotic behavior) replace the clocks.  My thesis is available [here][10].

<font size="5">Senior Seminar</font> - In the Spring of 2007 I took a senior seminar class (though I was a junior at the time) which covered representation theory and differences sets.  In this class we had two groups projects.  The [first paper][7] focused on representation theory.  The [second paper][8] focused on difference sets.

<font size="5">MAP</font> - In the summer of 2006 I did a mentored research project with Professor Keri Kornelson at Grinnell College.  I worked with another student (Ben Backup), where we studied properties of tight frames.  Tight frames are a generalization of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra.  In this project we used a simple geometric approach to study tight frames in the plane, then worked to generalize our results to higher dimensions.  We summarized our results in [this][9] paper.

# Teaching

Integral Calculus Instructor - In the sumer of 2011 I taught a summer session course in integral calculus.  [This][11] link provided is to the course web page, which gives samples of quizzes and tests I wrote, along with other stud aids.
