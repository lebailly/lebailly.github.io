# About Me

My name is Chris LeBailly.  I am a life long learner and problem solver.  



# Background

I began this journey as a student. In 2008 I got my BA in Mathematics and Music (and was close to a third major in physics) at Grinnell College.  I explored the world of teaching by spend two years working in the Math Study Center at Evanston Township High School.  Here I got sharpen my communication skills (OTHER TRANSFERABLE SKILLS).  In 2010 I decied to futher my knowledge by starting graduate studies in mathematics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  While I enjoyed furthering my eudcation, I realized that academia was not my calling professionally and switched to the masters track.  

While teaching was the natural path to follow, I wanted to explore other options.  I may choose to teach at some point latter in my life, but I want to fill my life with diverse experiences, both personally and profesionally.  

I opted to do a masters thesis with a substantal computation element.  After getting my masters, I took a class in bioinformatics to explore a new field

I'm excited to ... I have been faciniated by ...

In this website I present a selection of works I have created.

# Programs

<font size="5">Masters Thesis</font> - My masters thesis is available [here][3], while the code used for it is availble in the linked repo.

<font size="5">[Bioinformatics: models and algorithms](https://github.com/lebailly/BME205) </font> - Programs writen for [this][2] bioinformatics course, taken in the Fall of 2013 at UC Santa Cruz.

<font size="5">[Titanic Data Project](https://github.com/lebailly/Titanic)</font> - In this project I apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.  This project (and data) was obtained from this [Kaggle compeition][1].

<font size="5">[Baseball Park Fairness](https://github.com/lebailly/BallParkFairness)</font> - Different ball parks in major league baseball are in different location and have different dimensions.  How fair is this?  This question is addressed using both simulations and data anlysis.  While this work is a recent project, it is based of a paper produced for the HiMCM competition, which was published.

<font size="5">Predictors for MPG </font> - In this project I looked at different regression models to understand how different factors affect the mileage of cars in the `R` dataset `mtcars`.

<font size="5">[ML Project](https://github.com/lebailly/MLProject)</font> - In this project I build different machine learnign algorithms to predict the type of movement being preformed using data

<font size="5">[FitBit Project](https://github.com/lebailly/RepData_PeerAssessment1)</font> - In this project I explore a data from a person wearing a personal activity monitoring device.

# Mathematics

<font size="5"> Masters Thesis</font> - I studied a phenomena observed in the 17th century by Christiaan Huygens. He found that two pendulum clocks placed on a common support synchronized over time. I looked a model of this type of coupling.  I looked at what happens when driven pendulums (which can exhibit chaotic behavior) replace the clcoks.  The code used for these simulations is available here.

<font size="5">Senior Seminar Paper</font> - In the Spring of 2007 I took a senior seminar class (though I was a junior at the time) which covered representation theory and differences sets.  In this class we had two groups projects.  The first paper focused on represntation theoyr.  The second paper focused on difference sets.

<font size="5">MAP</font> - In the summer of 2006 I did a mentored research project with Professor Keri Kornelson at Grinnell College.  I worked with another student (Ben Backup), where we studied properites of tight frames.  Tight frames are a genralizaiotn of an orthnormal basis from linear algebra.  In this project we used a simple geometric approach to study tight frames in the plane, then worked to generalize our results to higher dimensions.

# Teaching

Integral Calculus Instructor - In the sumer of 2011 I taught a summer session course in integral calculus.  The link provided is to the course webpage, which gives samples of quizes and tests I wrote, along with other stud aids.

Other materials prepared for section, at ETHS, and so forth.
