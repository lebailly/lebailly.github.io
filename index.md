# Background

My name is Chris LeBailly.  I will add more information about my background here.

Here are some projects I have worked on:

# Projects

### Masters Thesis

My masters thesis is available [here][3], while the coding files are in the repo linked above.

### [Bioinformatics: models and algorithms](https://github.com/lebailly/BME205)
Programs writen for [this][2] bioinformatics course, taken in the Fall of 2013 at UC Santa Cruz.

### [Titanic Data Project](https://github.com/lebailly/Titanic)
In this project I apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.  This project (and data) was obtained from this [Kaggle compeition][1].

### [Baseball Park Fairness](https://github.com/lebailly/BallParkFairness)

Different ball parks in major league baseball are in different location and have different dimensions.  How fair is this?  This question is addressed using both simulations and data anlysis.

### Predictors for MPG

In this project I looked at different regression models to understand how different factors affect the mileage of cars in the `R` dataset `mtcars`.

### [ML Project](https://github.com/lebailly/MLProject)

In this project I build different machine learnign algorithms to predict the type of movement being preformed using data

### [FitBit Project](https://github.com/lebailly/RepData_PeerAssessment1)

In this project I explore a data from a person wearing a personal activity monitoring device.
