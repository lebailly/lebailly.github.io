My name is Chris LeBailly.  I will add more information about my background here.

Here are some projects I have worked on:

### Titanic Data Project

### Baseball Park Fairness

In the Fall of 2003 I participated in the COMPAPS High School Mathematical Competition in Modeling.  In this competition we told to look at different parks in major league baseball (which are in different location and have different dimensions) and address how fair.  For the compeitition my team addressed this with a model (EXPLAIN).  I have recently recast the orriginal C++ program in Python and have also addressed this same question using data analytic and sabermetric techniques.
