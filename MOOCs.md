# Data Science Specialization

Johns Hopkins University has put together a series of nine courses related to data science.  In addition to these foundational courses, this specialization offered the opportunity to do a capstone project upon competition of the courses.  At the current time, I have completed the foundational courses.  The capstone project has not been offered yet, but I look forward to it once it is available.  More details about the specialization are available [here][0].
