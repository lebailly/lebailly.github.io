Masters Thesis (once reworked)

<font size="5">[Exercise Type Predictionn](https://github.com/lebailly/MLProject)</font> - Using data form fitness tracking devices (similar to Fit Bits), I use different machine learning algorithms to predict the type of movements.

<font size="5">[FitBit Project](https://github.com/lebailly/RepData_PeerAssessment1)</font> - In this project I explore a data from a person wearing a personal activity monitoring device.

<font size="5">Masters Thesis</font> - My masters thesis is available [here][3], while the code used for it is availble in the linked repo.)

<font size="5">Predictors for MPG </font> - In this project I looked at different regression models to understand how different factors affect the mileage of cars in the `R` dataset `mtcars`.
