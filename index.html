<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Chris LeBailly. I am a life long learner and problem solver.</p>
<p>I began this journey as a student. At <a href="http://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a> I double majored in mathematics and music, and was close to a third major in physics. After graduation I worked for two years in the Math Study Center at <a href="http://www.eths.k12.il.us/">Evanston Township High School</a>. I worked with students of varying abilities in mathematics, where I was able to explain the simple ideas of basic algebra to the more advanced underpinnings of Calculus to the more accelerated students. I left this job to pursue graduate studies at the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>. While I enjoyed furthering my education, I realized that academia was not my calling professionally and switched to the masters track (where I completed my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/Thesis.pdf">masters thesis</a>).</p>
<p>Since finishing my masters I have taken <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/bme205/f13/index.html">this</a> graduate level course in bioinformatics (through the UCSC Extension Program) to learn about the field and sharpen my programing skills, taken several <a href="MOOCs.html">Massively Open On-line Courses</a>, as well as worked on several independent data projects. I want to make a positive difference in the world, and I am hoping to find a career path where I can use my analytic and programing skills to do this.</p>
<p>I am a self-motivated individual who can clearly communicate his ideas. I am excited to enter a field which will not only allows, but requires, me to continue to learn and grow as technology evolves. I am excited to have this opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="programing">Programing</h1>
<p>My native programing language was C++, however I have not coded in C++ since 2004. Since then I have worked primarily in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. I have also worked some with <strong>Octave</strong>/<strong>Matlab</strong> and to a lesser extent with <strong>Mathematica</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/BME205"><strong>Bioinformatics: models and algorithms</strong></a> - Programs written for <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/bme205/f13/index.html">this</a> bioinformatics course, taken in the Fall of 2013 at UC Santa Cruz. My favorite project was the alignment programing assignment. The derivation of the recursive algorithm to align the protein sequences appeal to the mathematician in me. After deriving the theoretical frame work, I enjoyed learning how to implement this algorithm using dynamic program.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/BallParkFairness"><strong>Baseball Park Fairness</strong></a> - Different ball parks in major league baseball are in different location and have different dimensions. How fair is this? Here fairness is assessed by how easy it is to hit homer runs. This is addressed using both simulations and data analysis. I enjoyed this project as it combines several interests of mine - baseball, physics, math, programing, and data analysis.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/IntroToDataScience/tree/master/assignment1"><strong>Twitter Analysis</strong></a> - Collects current information from twitter and preform different types of basic analysis (such as listing the top hash tags and determining a numeric rating of the tweet sentiment). My favorite part of this project was thinking of algorithms to create scores for words that were not found in the sentiment dictionary.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/Titanic"><strong>Titanic Data Project</strong></a> - In this project I apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. This project (and data) was obtained from this <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">Kaggle compeition</a>. I have enjoyed learning about different machine learning algorithms through using this problem and data set.</p>

<p><strong>Masters Thesis</strong> - I studied a phenomena observed in the 17th century by Christian Huygens. He found that two pendulum clocks placed on a common support synchronized over time. I looked a model of this type of coupling. I looked at what happens when driven pendulums (which can exhibit chaotic behavior) replace the clocks. My thesis is available <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/Thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Seminar</strong> - In the Spring of 2007 I took a senior seminar class (though I was a junior at the time) which covered representation theory and differences sets. In this class we had two groups projects. The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/SeminarPaper1.pdf">first paper</a> focused on representation theory. The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/SeminarPaper2.pdf">second paper</a> focused on difference sets.</p>
<p><strong>Mentored Advanced Project</strong> - In the summer of 2006 I did a mentored research project with Professor Keri Kornelson at Grinnell College. I worked with another student (Ben Backup), where we studied properties of tight frames. Tight frames are a generalization of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra. In this project we used a simple geometric approach to study tight frames in the plane, then worked to generalize our results to higher dimensions. We summarized our results in <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/MAPWriteUp.pdf">this</a> paper.</p>
<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>
<p>In the sumer of 2012 I was the <strong>instructor</strong> of a summer session course in integral calculus. <a href="math19B.htm">This</a> link provided is to the course web page, which gives samples of quizzes and tests I wrote, along with other study aids.</p>
<p>I worked as a <strong>Teaching Assistant</strong> at UCSC for three years. My role as a TA varied from course to course, depending upon the instructors requests and needs. I was always required to grade exams. While it wasn't the most glamorous part of the job, I did get more proficient at it.</p>
<p>When sections were required (which resulted in larger attendance) I enjoyed creating worksheets for group work. It was fun to see students engaging in the problems. I used <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/Worksheets/Integrals.pdf">this</a> worksheet after completing the chapter on techniques of integration. Several features I like about this worksheet is that the problems go from easier to harder (so it can appeal to both weaker and stronger students), that problems which look similar require different techniques, and that some problems have multiple correct solutions. For example, problem 3 can be done with partial fractions, but is easier if the students realize it can also be done with a substitution. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1444851/Website/Worksheets/Series.pdf">This</a> is another worksheet I used after covering tests for series convergence. Once again this worksheet required students to think about not only which methods they needed, but which ones were the most efficient. Problems also went easier to harder, with the last few being very challenging. It was exciting when no one got it in section, but when I bumped into a student a day latter he was excited that he'd figured it out.</p>
