<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>My name is Chris LeBailly. I will add more information about my background here.</p>
<p>Here are some projects I have worked on:</p>
<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<h3 id="masters-thesis">Masters Thesis</h3>
<p>My masters thesis is available <a href="http://lebailly.github.io/Docs/">here</a>, while the coding files are in the repo linked above.</p>
<h3 id="bioinformatics-models-and-algorithms"><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/BME205">Bioinformatics: models and algorithms</a></h3>
<p>Programs writen for <a href="http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~karplus/bme205/f13/index.html">this</a> bioinformatics course, taken in the Fall of 2013 at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3 id="titanic-data-project"><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/Titanic">Titanic Data Project</a></h3>
<p>In this project I apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. This project (and data) was obtained from this <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">Kaggle compeition</a>.</p>
<h3 id="baseball-park-fairness"><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/BallParkFairness">Baseball Park Fairness</a></h3>
<p>Different ball parks in major league baseball are in different location and have different dimensions. How fair is this? This question is addressed using both simulations and data anlysis.</p>
<h3 id="predictors-for-mpg">Predictors for MPG</h3>
<p>In this project I looked at different regression models to understand how different factors affect the mileage of cars in the <code>R</code> dataset <code>mtcars</code>.</p>
<h3 id="ml-project"><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/MLProject">ML Project</a></h3>
<p>In this project I build different machine learnign algorithms to predict the type of movement being preformed using data</p>
<h3 id="fitbit-project"><a href="https://github.com/lebailly/RepData_PeerAssessment1">FitBit Project</a></h3>
<p>In this project I explore a data from a person wearing a personal activity monitoring device.</p>
